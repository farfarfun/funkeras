## [RPN: RegionProposal Network](https://yunyang1994.github.io/posts/RPN/#more)
--------------------

This repository is implemented for paper ["Expecting the Unexpected: Training Detectors for Unusual Pedestrians with Adversarial Imposters(CVPR2017)"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06283), which makes some improvements on the basis of region proposal network in [Faster-RCNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497).

## Synthetic datasets
--------------------

For training RPN, I use synthetic datasets which contains a set of 8239 images with one class (`pedestrian`). The data is available on [BaiduCloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QZAIakMVS0sJV0sjgv7v2w&shfl=sharepset). We isotropically scale each image to a resolution of 960×720, zero-padding as necessary.

**First of all, you need to download** [synthetic datasets](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QZAIakMVS0sJV0sjgv7v2w&shfl=sharepset) and put it in `./`

## Anchors Demo
--------------------
I think the most exciting things in the region proposal network is Anchors. I use 9 anchors at each sliding position. During training, a candidate bounding box will be treated as a positive if its intersection-over-union overlap with a ground-truth box exceeds 50%, and will be a negative for overlaps less than 10%. 

```bashrc
$ python demo.py
```

> In the above picture, the blue anchor boxes are positive samples. the red and black dots represent for the center position of positive, negative samples respectively.

9 anchors are generated by k-means algorithmn. This process is optional since I have integrated them in my code. But if you are not familiar with it, you can have a look it by

```bashrc
$ python kmeans.py
```

## Network Training
--------------------

```bashrc
$ python train.py
```
The model will automatically save weights `./RPN.h5` in each epoch. During neural network training， you can track the loss curve in Tensorboard and go to http://localhost:6006/ 

|score loss|boxes loss|total loss

```bashrc
=> epoch 1  step 1  total_loss: 0.402951  score_loss: 0.346327  boxes_loss: 0.056625
=> epoch 1  step 2  total_loss: 0.399650  score_loss: 0.344363  boxes_loss: 0.055287
......
=> epoch 10  step 4000  total_loss: 0.001989  score_loss: 0.000015  boxes_loss: 0.001973
```
Finally you can test `RPN.h5` with [test.py](https://github.com/YunYang1994/TensorFlow2.0-Examples/blob/master/4-Object_Detection/RPN/test.py) for 200 images. The prediction results are expected to save in `./prediction`. Here is my trained weight https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o6HeQou9sCczLA_rzkTPqg

```
$ python test.py
```
